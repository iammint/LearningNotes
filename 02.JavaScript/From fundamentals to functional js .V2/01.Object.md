Dont' make any excuses, cuz everyone has their own stories. That space where things become challenging is actually the space you wanna be in.

# 1. Property Access
```js
let person = {}
person.name = "Mint"
let who = person.name
console.log(who)//"Mint"
person.name = "Sam"
console.log(who)//still "Mint"
```

```js
let person = {}
person.name = "Mint"
let who = person.name
console.log(who)//"Mint"
person.name = "Sam"
who = person.name
console.log(who)//"Sam"

```

**Primitive value gets pass by value, while non-primitive value gets pass by reference.So we have these pointers in memory for objects.**

# 2. Bracket Notation
```js
let arr = []
arr.name = "Mint"
let who = arr.name 
console.log(who) //Mint
console.log(arr) //[name: "Mint"]
```
> The rules of Arrays and Objects are the same for the reason that arrays are objects.
>
> We use brackets for arrays but we also use them for objects.

```js
let arr = []
arr.name = "Mint"
let who = arr.name 
arr[0] = "I'm not that person who murdered him"
console.log(arr)
//["I'm not that person who murdered him", name: 'Mint']
```
We can't use arr.0 because the syntax is that the stuff after the dot must be strings. And that's why we can use arr.person cuz person is a string. 

```js
let person = {}
person.name = "Mint"
person[plea] = "I would never"
 console.log(person)
```

Likewise, We can not use arr[string].The brackets should contain variables or special symbols. But ["string"] can totally be used.

```js
let person = {}
let plea = "wouldShe"
person.name = "Mint"
person[plea] = "I would never"
console.log(person)
//{name: 'Mint', wouldShe: 'I would never'}
```

# 3. Non-valid characters
### About the naming of the key of object
If the key of an object is non-valid characters, there can not be without " ".
```js
let obj = {
    name: "Mint",
    age: 22,
    "_^*": "i am non-valid characters"
}
```

### The difference of using the dot between Objects and Arrays :
> Using the dot on an array will not change the length of it.
```js
let arr = []
arr.name = "Mint"
arr.age = 22
console.log(arr)
//[name: 'Mint', age: 22]
console.log(arr.length)
//❗0
```
> Also, other methods for Arrays don't work for the elements added in this way.

# Recap
1. What is the difference between the dot and the bracket?
2. How do you add a property with a key that contains special characters?
3. How do you add a property whose key and value are stored in different variables?
4. How do we loop through an object to access the values?

# Destructuring
> Destructuring is a simplified way of defining variables and taking them outside of a object or an array.

### Variable declarations
```js
const {first, second} = {first:0, second: 1}
console.log(first)//0
console.log(second)//1
```

### Assignment
```js
//This doesn't work
let a, b 
{a, b} = {a: 1, b: 2}
```
```js
//This works
({ a, b } = { a: 10, b: 20 });
console.log(a); // 10
console.log(b); // 20
```
> This due to the grammer in js.
> 
> Starting with {} implies a block scope, not an object literal.
> 
> ( ) converts to an expression
> 
> Note that object literals cannot appear in statement positions, so a plain object destructuring assignment statement { x } = y must be parenthesized either as ({ x } = y) or ({ x }) = y

There is no guarantee in the order of objects. Though it seems like it has an order. When you need ordered objects, arrays should be picked.
