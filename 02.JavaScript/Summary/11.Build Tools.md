# 1. Package managers —— npm

## 1.1 How to use npm

There are two ways of installing packages locally and globally. 

![install-packages-locally-globally.png](https://media.haochen.me/install-packages-locally-globally.png)

Generally, you'll want to install locally in the project folder. 
1. `cd < the project folder >`
2. `npm install < package name >`

`npm install < package name >`does two things — first, it downloads all the code from the package into a folder called `node_modules`. Second, it automatically modifies the `package.json `file to keep track of the package as a project dependency.

3. If you'd like to install specific version you can `npm install @2.17.0`

4. Update the lateset version `npm update < package name >`

This is useful later when sharing a project with others — instead of sharing the `node_modules` folder (which can get very large), you only need to share the `package.json` file and other developers can install the required packages automatically with the command   `npm install`.

So if you want to get other's project, just copy it and its `package.json`. then:
1. `npm install` command installs all the dependencies, including regular and dev-dependencies. 
2. `npm install --production` command only installs the regular dependencies.

|Version|^2.17.4|~2.17.4|2.17.4|*|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|`npm install` after getting others' project|Update the latest minor version|Update the latest patch version|Install the exact version|Install absolutely latest version|

`npm uninstall/remove/rm < package name >`can uninstall the package.

## 1.2 npm version

You can update the second and third one without worry about breaking your code. But for the first major one, your code's probably gonna break. 


`npm list --depth 0`can show the npm list.


## 1.3 link to packages in html

Looking inside the `node_modules` folder, we can see the moment.`min.js` file in the `node_modules/moment/min` directory. This means we can link to the npm downloaded version of `moment.min.js` in the `index.html` file as follows:

```js
  <script src="node_modules/moment/min/moment.min.js"></script>
```

But that’s still pretty inconvenient, so next we’ll take a look at how to automate that process as well.


CommonJS was started with the goal of specifying an ecosystem for JavaScript outside the browser. And the most well-known of implementation of CommonJS modules is node.js. 

Instead of loading all of moment.min.js with an HTML script tag, you can load it directly in the JavaScript file as follows:

```js
//index.js
let moment = require("moment")
```

## 1.4 Module bundler —— webpack

A JavaScript module bundler is a tool that gets around the problem with a build step, which has access to the file system to create a final output that is browser compatible. 

Let’s take a look at how to use webpack to get the above `require('moment')` example working in the browser. First we need to install webpack **into the project**. Webpack itself is an npm package, so we can install it from the command line:
```
$ npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```

Now we have webpack and webpack-cli installed as packages in the `node_modules` folder. You can use webpack-cli from the command line as follows:
```
$ ./node_modules/.bin/webpack index.js --mode=development
```

This command will find any `require` statements, and replace them with the appropriate code to create a single output file (which by default is **dist/main.js**).

Now we can use it in the html.
```js
  <script src="dist/main.js"></script>
```


Note that we’ll need to run the webpack command each time we change `index.js` to other file:
```
$ ./node_modules/.bin/webpack
```
