# 1. Package managers —— npm

## 1.1 How to use npm

There are two ways of installing packages locally and globally. 

![install-packages-locally-globally.png](https://media.haochen.me/install-packages-locally-globally.png)

Generally, you'll want to install locally in the project folder. 
1. `cd < the project folder >`
2. `npm install < package name >`

`npm install < package name >`does two things — first, it downloads all the code from the package into a folder called `node_modules`. Second, it automatically modifies the `package.json `file to keep track of the package as a project dependency.

3. If you'd like to install specific version you can `npm install @2.17.0`

4. Update the lateset version `npm update < package name >`

This is useful later when sharing a project with others — instead of sharing the `node_modules` folder (which can get very large), you only need to share the `package.json` file and other developers can install the required packages automatically with the command   `npm install`.

So if you want to get other's project, just copy it and its `package.json`. then:
1. `npm install` command installs all the dependencies, including regular and dev-dependencies. 
2. `npm install --production` command only installs the regular dependencies.

|Version|^2.17.4|~2.17.4|2.17.4|*|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|`npm install` after getting others' project|Update the latest minor version|Update the latest patch version|Install the exact version|Install absolutely latest version|

`npm uninstall/remove/rm < package name >`can uninstall the package.

## 1.2 npm version

You can update the second and third one without worry about breaking your code. But for the first major one, your code's probably gonna break. 


`npm list --depth 0`can show the npm list.


## 1.3 link to packages in html

Looking inside the `node_modules` folder, we can see the moment.`min.js` file in the `node_modules/moment/min` directory. This means we can link to the npm downloaded version of `moment.min.js` in the `index.html` file as follows:

```js
  <script src="node_modules/moment/min/moment.min.js"></script>
```

But that’s still pretty inconvenient, so next we’ll take a look at how to automate that process as well.


CommonJS was started with the goal of specifying an ecosystem for JavaScript outside the browser. And the most well-known of implementation of CommonJS modules is node.js. 

Instead of loading all of moment.min.js with an HTML script tag, you can load it directly in the JavaScript file as follows:

```js
//index.js
let moment = require("moment")
```

<font color="red" size=5>❗Again, this is all great for node.js, but if you tried to use the above code in the browser, you’d get an error saying require is not defined. The browser doesn’t have access to the file system. </font>


# 2. Module bundler —— webpack

A JavaScript module bundler is a tool that gets around the problem with a build step, which has access to the file system to create a final output that is browser compatible. 

Let’s take a look at how to use webpack to get the above `require('moment')` example working in the browser. First we need to install webpack **into the project**. Webpack itself is an npm package, so we can install it **in the project folder** from the command line:
 
```
$ npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```

Now we have webpack and webpack-cli installed as packages in the `node_modules` folder. You can use webpack-cli from the command line as follows:
```
$ ./node_modules/.bin/webpack index.js --mode=development
```

This command will find any `require` statements, and replace them with the appropriate code to create a single output file (which by default is **dist/main.js**).

Now we can use it in the html.
```js
  <script src="dist/main.js"></script>
```

Note that we’ll need to run the webpack command each time we change `index.js` to other file:
```
$ ./node_modules/.bin/webpack
```

## What is webpack?
> At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. 

When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph from one or more entry points and then combines every module your project needs into one or more bundles, which are static assets to serve your content from.

![Snipaste_2022-07-09_21-31-51.png](https://media.haochen.me/Snipaste_2022-07-09_21-31-51.png)

## 1. Entry
> An **entry point** indicates which module webpack should use to begin buidling out its internal dependency graph. 

After installing webpack, you can use it to create a bundle(get an access from) the command line by adding some scipts to the `scripts` section in the `packages.json` file. 

```json
//difine the start point and end point of the bundle
"scripts": {
    "build": "webpack ./test.js --output-path dist --mode=development"
}
//Compress your code in production mode
"scripts-prod": {
    "build": "webpack ./test.js --output-path dist --mode=development -p"
}
```

Then `npm run build` will create a bundle called `main.js` in the `dist` folder. Finally, you can use the `main.js` file in the html.

```js
//In the html file
//❗You need to add the type="module" to the script tag.
<script src="dist/main.js" type="module"></script>
```

## 2. Output
> An **output** is where webpack will put the bundled files. It defaults to ./dist/main.js for the main output file and to the ./dist folder for any other generated file.

## 3. Loaders
> A **loader** is a piece of code that webpack will run on your code before it gets bundled. Loaders are used to transform other resources into javascript.

At a high level, **loaders** have two properties in your webpack configuration: `test` and `loaders`.

- The `test` property  is a regular expression that identifies which files should be transformed.
- The `use` property is an array of loaders which will be used to transform the files.

```js
// In the webpack.config.js file
const path = require("path")
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [{ test: /\.txt$/, use: 'raw-loader' }]
  }
}
// This tells webpack's loader to use the `raw-loader` to transform all .txt files.
```
 
```js
// In the test.js

```
