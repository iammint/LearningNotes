# 'let' can create a block scope while 'var' can not.
```js
var Actual
outer("first arg", function() {
    var fn = function() {
    var where = "outer"
    {
        let where = "inner"
    }
    Actual = where
    }
    fn()
    console.log(Actual)//"outer"
})
```
```js
var Actual
outer("first arg", function() {
    var ACTUAL = null
    var fn = function() {
    var where = "outer"
    {
        var where = "inner"
    }
    Actual = where
    }
    fn()
    console.log(Actual)//"inner"
})
```
This kind of block scope is used in lots of places like 'if' statement, 'switch' statement, loop and so on.

# But 'let' and 'var' both create function scope
```js
function fn1() {
    var/let a = 1
}
console.log(a)//both undefined
```

# Scope
```js
(function() {
var fn1 = function() {
    var local = "Mint"
    fn2()
}
var fn2 = function() {
    ACTUAL = local
}
except(function() {
    fn2()
    //will throw an error, since fn2 doesn't have access to the variable local
}).to.be.true()
except(function() {
    fn1()
}).to.be.true()
//fn1 will be called and declare local = "Mint",
//then fn2 will be called
//but fn2 will not be called in the scope of fn1
//it's just called down there where fn1 was called
//so still, fn2 and fn1 have totally different scopes,
//therefore it will also throw an error
except(ACTUALL===null).to.be.true()
})()
```


# Is it gonna work?
```js
var fn1 = function( ) {
    fn2()
}
var fn2 = function() {
    console.log("hi")
}
fn1()
```
Yes! cuz though it seems like fn2() was declared after fn1 was called, but it's not like that. Cuz only when fn1 was called, fn2 would be called.  As long as fn2 was declared before fn1 was called, it would work.
# But if it's like this...
```js
fn1()
var/let fn1 = function( ) {
    console.log("hi")
}
```
No! It won't work cuz this is the oppsite example of last one. There is no hoisting in the Function Expression(赋值).Though it will work in the Function Declaration(声明).
```js
fn1()
function fn1 ( ) {
    console.log("hi")
}
//This will work.
```
# Every invocation of the function will create a new execution context
```js
var fn = function() {
var localVariable
if(localVariable === undefined) {
    ACTUAL = "alpha"
}
else if(localVariable === "initialized") {
    ACTUAL = "omega"
}
localVariable = "initialized"
}
fn()
//ACTUAL === "alpha"
fn()
//ACTUAL === "alpha"
```

```js
(function() {
    let ACTUAL = 0
    it('between calls to an inner function,
     that inner function retains access to a variable in an outer scope. 
     Modifying those variables has a lasting effect between calls to the inner function.', function() {
        var outerCounter = 10
        var fn = function() {
            outerCounter = outerCounter + 1
            //if you add var/let here, you will get NaN,
            //cuz in that case outerCounter will not point to the outerCounter ouside the fn
            ACTUAL = outerCounter
        }
        fn()
        //ACTUAL === 11
        fn()
        //ACTUAL === 12

        window.innerFn = fn
    })
    window.innerFn()
    //ACTUAL === 13
})()
```
The value of outerCounter will be only reset when the outer function "it" is called, for the reason that a brandnew execution context will be created. But here we actually only called the inner function "fn", so a brandnew execution context was created. Though it seems like we are running a function up there, but actually it exists to where is's called. Also there is a backpack with the value of outerCounter stored.
